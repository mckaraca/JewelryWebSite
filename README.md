 # JewelryWebSite
This is my first react project.I used reactjs in this project. I have built a homepage first and added navigation bar later on.
Products wer placed on this page, then button feature was given to products. There are products on the entered pages. You can make 
your payment with the finish shopping button after adding products to the cart.If you want to be a member, you can register or you can keep shopping without being a member.
